# Scopes

- Declare a global variable called globalVar
- Declare a function that contains both block and function variables, called blockVar and functionVar respectively
- Variables must be declared using let or const (var cannot be used)
- Once finished, commit these changes and move on to the next point.
- Commit and push to GitHub. The neatness of the commits will be evaluated.
- Closures (Research)
- Define a global variable
- Create a function that accepts a parameter (called paramVar) and declares a local function variable (called functionVar)
- Within that function, declare another block of code (e.g., a loop or an if statement) with a block variable.
- Within this block, create another nested function (closure) that modifies and accesses variables from different scope levels (global, function, block).
- Commit and push to GitHub. The neatness of the commits will be evaluated.
